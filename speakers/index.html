              from early student days. He is a B. Tech. in Computer Science and
              an alumnus of IIM Calcutta.The self taught artist brings a style
              of abstraction and distortion in depicting the Indian classical
              dance forms in this present series. His experience of over 10
              years is visible in each of his painting in this series
              aesthetically engaging in its own vibrant colours with harmony. He
              also brings in a sense of intrigue due to fragmentation of the
              subject being a novelty and uniqueness of his style.
